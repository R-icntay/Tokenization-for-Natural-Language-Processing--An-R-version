# Tokenization for Natural Language Processing: An R version

Hello! Welcome to the eighth R code walkthrough of the series [Machine Learning Foundations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z9TRANg4c0&list=PLOU2XLYxmsII9mzQ-Xxug4l2o04JBrkLV) where Laurence Moroney,a Developer Advocate at Google working on Artificial Intelligence, takes us through the fundamentals of building machine learned models using TensorFlow.

In this episode, Episode 8, we switch gears from computer vision and take a look at Natural Language Processing (NLP), beginning with tokenization â€“how a computer can represent language in a numeric format that can be used in training neural networks.

Like the previous R Notebooks, this Notebook tries to replicate the Python Notebook used for this episode.


 You can find the R blog post of this code on [Rpubs](https://rpubs.com/eR_ic/mlr_8).
